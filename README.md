# ResuCraft

## üöÄ A Tale of Innovation and Empowerment

In my freshman year of college, faced with the daunting task of job hunting on campus, I stumbled upon a recurring hurdle - the cost of creating a professional resume. Services like Zety, charging $74.99 annually or $3.99 per resume, were a luxury I couldn't afford. This challenge sparked a realization: the process of crafting a resume, a gateway to opportunities, shouldn't be gated by financial constraints. Thus, ResuCraft was born - not just as a project, but as a mission to democratize professional resume building.
